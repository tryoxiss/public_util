For the find replace lists, its `find,replace,` with any duplicates being aliases of the same. It is case sensitive, but it should be case insensitive unless there is something with capitals. (For example: `:abcd:` and `:ABCD:`). 

Some have unnamed find replaces, such as the emojis, They are `un_<real>`, there the number is the line number I was on at the time.

The first line is reserved for metadata. 
`emojisoruce,none` means find and replace with the shortcode with the character, if you have `emojisource,domain/path` then it will refrence the file, defaulting to whatever exists after that (i.e., ignoring file extensions) unless conflicts exist, where it will defult to png.
